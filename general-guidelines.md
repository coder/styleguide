# General guidelines

- Use the second person
- Use the active voice
- Use plural nouns and pronouns (*they*, *their*, or *them*), especially when
  the specific number is uncertain (i.e., "Set up your environments" even though
  you don't know if the user will have one or many environments)
- When writing documentation titles, use the noun form, not the gerund form (e.g., "Environment
  Management" instead of "Managing Environments")
- Context matters when you decide whether to capitalize something or not. For
  example, ["A Job creates one or more
  Pods..."](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) is
  correct when writing about Kubernetes. However, in other contexts, neither
  *job* nor *pods* would be capitalized. Please follow the conventions set forth
  by the relevant companies and open source communities.
