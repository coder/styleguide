# Product-specific references

This article summarizes the guidelines regarding how Coder terms should be used.

## Capitalized terms

The only Coder-specific terms that should be capitalized are the names of
products:

- Coder Free
- Coder Enterprise
- Coder Cloud

The exception is code-server, which is always lowercase. If it appears at the
beginning of the sentence, it is capitalized, but we encourage you to rewrite
the sentence to avoid this usage if possible.

## Uncapitalized terms

In general, we do not capitalize the names of features (unless the situation calls for it,
such as the word appearing at the beginning of a sentence):

- account dormancy
- audit logs
- autostart
- command-line interface
- dev URLs
- environment
- image
- metrics
- organizations
- progressive web app
- registries
- single sign-on
- telemetry
- workspace
- workspace providers
- workspaces as code

We also do not capitalize the names of user roles:

- auditor
- member
- site admin
- site manager
