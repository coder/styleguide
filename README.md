# Product Docs Style Guide

This style guide is primarily for use with [Coder docs](coder.com/docs). It is
not exhaustive; instead, it covers the issues you'll likely encounter when
writing Coder docs.

For all other types of material generated on behalf of Coder, see the marketing
team's [style guide (internal
