# Product Docs Style Guide

This style guide is primarily for use with [Coder docs](coder.com/docs). It does not
supersede any of Coder's style guides; rather it augments any existing style
guides and design systems.

Additionally, this style guide is not exhaustive; instead, it covers the
issues you'll likely encounter when writing Coder docs.
